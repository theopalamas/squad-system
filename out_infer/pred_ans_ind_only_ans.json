intractable for more than the smallest inputs. in fact, the cobham \u2013 edmonds thesis states that only those problems that can be solved in polynomial time can be feasibly computed on some computational device. problems that are known to be intractable in this sense include those that are exptime - hard. if np is not the same as p, then the np - complete problems are also intractable in this sense. to see why exponential - time algorithms might be unusable in practice, consider a program that makes 2n operations before halting. for small n, say 100, and assuming for the sake of example that the computer does 1012 operations each second, the program would run for about 4 \u00d7 1010 years, which is the same order of magnitude as the age of the universe. even with a much faster computer, the program would only be useful for very small instances and in that sense the intractability of a problem is somewhat independent of technological progress. nevertheless, a
