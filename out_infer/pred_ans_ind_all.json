[SEP] the primary law of the eu consists mainly of the founding treaties, the \" core \" treaties being the treaty on european union ( teu ) and the treaty on the functioning of the european union ( tfeu ). the treaties contain formal and substantive provisions, which frame policies of the european union institutions and determine the division of competences between the european union and its member states. the teu establishes that european union law applies to the metropolitan territories of the member states, as well as certain islands and overseas territories, including madeira, the canary islands and the french overseas departments. european union law also applies in territories where a member state is responsible for external relations, for example gibraltar and the aland islands. the teu allows the european council to make specific provisions for regions, as for example done for customs matters in gibraltar and saint - pierre - et - miquelon. the teu specifically excludes certain regions, for example the faroe islands, from the jurisdiction of european union law. treaties apply as soon as they enter into force, unless stated otherwise, and are generally concluded for an unlimited period. the teu provides that commitments entered into by the member states between themselves before the treaty was signed no longer apply. [ vague ] all eu member states are regarded as subject to the general obligation of the principle of cooperation, as stated in the teu, whereby member states are obliged not to take measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the teu objectives. the court of justice of the european union can interpret the treaties, but it cannot rule on their", "5725ca4389a1e219009abeb7": "", "5725ca4389a1e219009abeb8": "soon as they enter into", "57268d2ddd62a815002e894e": "the treaty on european", "57268d2ddd62a815002e894f": "gibraltar and the aland", "57268d2ddd62a815002e8950": "as soon as they enter into", "57268d2ddd62a815002e8951": "court of justice of the european", "5ad10f94645df0001a2d0bc4": "", "5ad10f94645df0001a2d0bc5": "", "5ad10f94645df0001a2d0bc6": "", "5ad10f94645df0001a2d0bc7": "", "5ad10f94645df0001a2d0bc8": "", "5725cc38ec44d21400f3d5bb": "common rules for coal and steel, and then atomic", "5725cc38ec44d21400f3d5bc": "treaty of rome 1957 and the maastricht treaty 1992 ( now : tfeu", "5725cc38ec44d21400f3d5bd": "", "5725cc38ec44d21400f3d5be": "", "5725cc38ec44d21400f3d5bf": "", "57268e2bf1498d1400e8e3b0": "common rules for coal and steel, and then atomic", "57268e2bf1498d1400e8e3b1": "", "57268e2bf1498d1400e8e3b2": "", "57268e2bf1498d1400e8e3b3": "", "57268e2bf1498d1400e8e3b4": "", "5ad11097645df0001a2d0be0": "", "5ad11097645df0001a2d0be1": "", "5ad11097645df0001a2d0be2": "", "5ad11097645df0001a2d0be3": "", "5ad11097645df0001a2d0be4": "", "57264865dd62a815002e8062": "following the nice", "57264865dd62a815002e8063": "", "57264865dd62a815002e8064": "very", "57264865dd62a815002e8065": "amending", "57264865dd62a815002e8066": "", "57268f2bf1498d1400e8e3c4": "constitutional law of the european", "57268f2bf1498d1400e8e3c5": "make it more", "57268f2bf1498d1400e8e3c6": "", "57268f2bf1498d1400e8e3c7": "lisbon", "5ad11186645df0001a2d0bfe": "", "5ad11186645df0001a2d0bff": "", "5ad11186645df0001a2d0c00": "", "5ad11186645df0001a2d0c01": "lisbon", "5ad11186645df0001a2d0c02": "", "57264a8cdd62a815002e808c": "", "57264a8cdd62a815002e808d": "", "57264a8cdd62a815002e808e": "the commission ' s", "57264a8cdd62a815002e808f": "", "57264a8cdd62a815002e8090": "federica mogherin", "572691545951b619008f76e1": "article", "572691545951b619008f76e2": "the commission ' s", "572691545951b619008f76e3": "by a simple majority", "572691545951b619008f76e4": "", "572691545951b619008f76e5": "", "5ad11288645df0001a2d0c30": "", "5ad11288645df0001a2d0c31": "", "5ad11288645df0001a2d0c32": "", "5ad11288645df0001a2d0c33": "", "5ad11288645df0001a2d0c34": "", "57264e455951b619008f6f65": "santer", "57264e455951b619008f6f66": "", "57264e455951b619008f6f67": "", "57264e455951b619008f6f68": "[CLS] who appoints the board of the european central bank?
